# Uncommon Expo CLI Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive error encountered when using the Expo CLI. The error message is often vague, making it difficult to pinpoint the root cause. This repository provides examples and solutions to some of the most puzzling issues.

**Problem:**

During the development of a React Native app using Expo, uncommon errors could occur during project setup, build, or start process.  These are not standard errors and require more in-depth debugging.

**Solutions:**

The main focus of this repository is addressing these unconventional errors via several approaches:

* **Dependency Issues:** Verify and resolve dependencies' conflicts and compatibility issues.
* **Configuration Errors:** Review and correct configuration files such as `app.json` and `expo.json`.
* **Cache Management:** Clear the cache files to ensure they don't conflict with the new build process. 
* **Environment Variables:** Make sure the necessary environment variables are set correctly.
* **Native Modules:** If using native modules, follow Expo's guidelines for linking and setup. 

The solutions include code examples and detailed steps to resolve the errors.
