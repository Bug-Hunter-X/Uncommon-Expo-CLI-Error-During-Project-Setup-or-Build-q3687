This solution demonstrates fixing a common issue of incorrect or missing dependencies leading to Expo CLI errors. 

```javascript
// expoclierrorsolution.js
const { Command } = require('commander');
const program = new Command();

program
  .command('install-fix')
  .description('Fixes dependency issues with Expo CLI')
  .action(() => {
    console.log('Attempting to fix dependency issues...');
    //This is the core of the solution. This will install all missing and resolve the version conflicts. 
    require('child_process').execSync('expo install', { stdio: 'inherit' });
    console.log('Dependencies installation complete. Please restart the Expo CLI.');
  });

program.parse(process.argv);
```

This script uses the `child_process` module to run the `expo install` command, which reinstalls all dependencies.  Error handling could be added for production.

Additional steps might be required depending on the exact error message. Refer to the README for more comprehensive solutions and scenarios.
